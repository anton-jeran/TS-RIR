# TS-RIR

This is the official implementation of **IR-GAN**. We started our implementation from [**WaveGAN**](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan). TS-RIRGAN is one dimensional CycleGAN that takes synthetic RIRs as raw waveform audio and translate it into real RIRs. Our network architecture is shown below.
